# LinkedIn Sharing Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you share your Tic Tac Toe with a Twist game on LinkedIn to showcase your development skills.

## Step 1: Deploy Your Game First

Before sharing on LinkedIn, make sure your game is live and accessible:

### Option A: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy via Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository: `raghavdharani/TTT`
   - Vercel will auto-detect and deploy
   - Your game will be live at: `https://ttt-xxx.vercel.app`

3. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - Add a custom domain in Vercel settings
   - Example: `tictactoe-twist.yourname.com`

### Option B: Other Hosting Options

- **Netlify**: Similar to Vercel, free hosting
- **GitHub Pages**: Free but requires some setup
- **Your own domain**: If you have web hosting

## Step 2: Create a LinkedIn Post
